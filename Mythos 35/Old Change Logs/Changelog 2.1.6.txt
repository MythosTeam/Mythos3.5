# Description
#############
-Main plans for this update was a expansion of flavor events, but progress was cut short by a change in the team.
-Had to be rushed out for a new steam page, as such most changes are focused on dragons, as we had not yet began work on others.
-Future updates will be more expansive, and include more flavor for the other groups.
-We are now recruiting new team members. If interested, join the discord https://discord.gg/GxZwZHScqE
