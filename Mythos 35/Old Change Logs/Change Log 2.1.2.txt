# Bloodlines
############

- With Holy Fury, the Blood of the Gods trait has been replaced with Blood of the Gods bloodlines
- Different gods will have different bloodlines
- Blood of the Gods bloodlines are passed on to only biological children, including bastards, even if they are unacknowledged
- Blood of the Gods may not always be passed on to children, especially if only one parent has a divine bloodline or the the children is further from divinity
- Characters can only have a single divine bloodline, with more specific bloodlines, such as "Blood of Zeus" taking precidence over more generic ones, like "Blood of Olympus"
- Currently, only the Germanic and Greco-Roman pantheons have god- or pantheon-specific bloodlines. Others will use a generic "Blood of the Gods" bloodline type.
- Characters with certain divine bloodlines are more likely to pick appropriate focuses
- Characters with bloodlines from gods known for chastity are harder to seduce
- AI characters, especially gods, that have certain bloodlines may seduce outside of their court
