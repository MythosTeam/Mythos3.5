EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.9;The feeling of [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s blood sliding through my throat is exquisite.  I didn't want to stop, but I still let go before it was enough to kill [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.9;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s blood was just what I needed.  Unfortunately, I become so lost in the taste that I wasn't paying attention to the door.  When someone walked in, I barely managed to escape, and they may have seen a glimpse of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.9;It's only a suspicion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPC_VAMPIRE.9;I was careless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.11;As I walked through the hall, I felt a deep unease, as though some unhallowed figure was following me.  It was not long after that I was set upon by [From.GetBestName], who I thought my [GetFromRelation]!  As I threw [From.GetHerHim] off, I saw [From.GetHerHis] fangs and pallid skin and knew the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.11;A vampire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.12;As I stalked [FromFrom.GetBestName] through the halls, I thought I saw my opportunity, but as I set myself upon [FromFrom.GetHerHim], [FromFrom.GetSheHe] managed to fight me off.

EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.12;This is not good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.13;As I stalked [FromFrom.GetBestName] through the halls, it seems that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] became aware of my presence and managed to escape.  My wounds still ache.  I may need to find another victim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

tt_vampire_revealed;[From.GetFullName]'s true nature is revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_VAMPIRE.24;True Nature Revealed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.24;After my sudden and inexplicable recovery, there's no longer any use in hiding who I am - Everyone now knows that I'm a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.24;At least I don't need to hide now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.25;Not only did I fail to feed on [From.GetBestName], [From.GetSheHe] realized what I was doing and now my secret is out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.25;Everyone knows I'm a vampire now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.26;As the years pass, time has left me unchanged.  This has drawn suspicion for some time, but now people has figured out my dark secret.  They know I am a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.26;It was only a matter of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.29;My hunger grew too strong and got the better of me.  I lost control, killed [From.GetBestName], and drained [From.GetHerHim] of [From.GetHerHis] blood without even checking for witnesses.  Now everyone knows I'm a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.29;My secret's out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.30;My hunger grew too strong and I lost myself in it.  I bared my fangs and leapt right at [From.GetBestName], intending to feast on [From.GetHerHis] blood, not caring who saw, but [From.GetSheHe] drove me off.  Now, everyone knows I'm a vampire, and I didn't even get to feed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.30;I'm still hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.31;I let my hunger get the best of me.  I grabbed [From.GetBestName] and drank my fill without making sure there wasn't anyone nearby.  It was only luck that I'm made such a mess that no one realized what I was doing and just thought it a mundane murder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.31;Not good, but it could be worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.32;I let my hunger get the best of me.  Before I knew what I was doing, I had drained [From.GetBestName] dry.  Unfortunately, this meant I didn't have a good alibi and people knew I would be there.  No one can prove anything, but everyone suspects that I am a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.32;I can't afford to lose control like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.33;I lost control of myself in my hunger and found myself mindlessly stalking [From.GetBestName].  Fortunately, I caught myself right before [From.GetSheHe] entered a crowded room.  If I hadn't, I may have fed on [From.GetHerHim] right in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.33;I need to get this hunger under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.34;I lost control of myself in my hunger.  Before I even realized what I was doing, I have completely drained [From.GetBestName].  It was only luck that saved me from getting caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.34;I can't afford to be so careless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.35;It's been a while since I've fed properly.  Deep inside me, I can feel that unholy hunger clawing its way out.  My mind focuses on only one thing: I need blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.35;I must feed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.37;I left my hunger take control of me.  I was too focused on sating my dark urges to properly pick my prey.  Although I managed to kill and feed on [From.GetBestName], [From.GetSheHe] managed to injure me in the stuggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.37;I need to be more careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.38;While I find myself struggling with my hunger for human blood, other needs have passed.  With no need for human food and drink, I find my old cravings gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.38;I do not drink... wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.40;I was able to sneak in on [From.GetBestName] while [From.GetSheHe] was sleeping and feed.  I could not drink my fill, but I was able to get out without raising any suspicion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.40;My hunger is slaked for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.41;I tried to find an opportunity to get [From.GetBestName] alone, but [From.GetSheHe] just seems to move from crowd to crowd, with no opportunity to feed on [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.41;Perhaps I'll try again later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.42;I managed to catch [From.GetBestName] asleep and began to feed on a bit of [From.GetHerHis] blood, but it seems I was a bit too rough an [From.GetSheHe] awoke and escaped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.42;This could cause trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.43;As I was stalking [From.GetBestName], [From.GetSheHe] became aware of what I was doing.  I made up an excuse, but I don't think [From.GetSheHe] believed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.44;I tried to be stealthy, but apparently not enough - I was caught trying to feed on [From.GetTitledName] before I could drink any of [From.GetHerHis] blood.  Now my secret's out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.45;I went to feed on my prisoner [From.GetTitledName] when [From.GetSheHe] turned into a werewolf, attacked me, then escaped from my dungeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.45;At least [From.GetSheHe] is exposed now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.46;As I was waiting in prison, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] dismissed the guards and entered my cell.  I took the opportunity to shapeshift, attack [FromFrom.GetHerHim], and get out.  I had to reveal myself, but I suspect waiting would have been far worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.46;Why did [FromFrom.GetSheHe] dismiss the guards anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.47;As I was walking around, I noticed that [From.GetTitledName] was stalking me with a feral hungry look in [From.GetHerHis] eyes.  I barely managed to lose [From.GetHerHim], but something tells me that I barely survived this encounter - that [From.GetSheHe] is some kind of predator ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.47;Werewolf? Vampire?  Something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.48;I'm not really show how it happened... I must have fallen asleep.  When I woke up, I was in pain and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] was biting my neck, drinking my blood.  I'm not sure why, but [FromFrom.GetSheHe] left before taking enough blood to kill me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.48;I've been attacked by a vampire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.50;I really haven't been feeling well for the last day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.50;It must have been someone I ate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.53;As lesser men rise above me, I cannot help but feel I'm wasting my immortality.  Real power is within my reach but I've yet to claim it;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.53;I will rule [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.53;I won't sit idle any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.54;As I look around the realm and its neighbors, I can't help but feel that they've taken far more from me than I should have allowed.  I am their natural master and their lives are mine by right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.54;None of them deserve any of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.54;I've been too soft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.55;While my position comes with no small amount of power, I feel I could gain even more control if I were to focus on consolidating and building power in a single area;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.55;I should focus on building up political influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.55;The realm's armies should be loyal to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.55;Gold is power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_VAMPIRE.55;Things are working well as they are now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.56;Gaining any sort of real influence will take not only time and effort, but gold.  Whether for bribes, buying property, or just ensuring normal business runs properly, there are costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.56;I can put some money aside for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.56;I'm sure it will be worth the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.56;Perhaps this isn't worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.58;Through various informants, I have learned that [From.GetTitledName] is making moves to take control of much of the capital's staff.  [From.GetSheHeCap] would have control over who has access to the [Root.Liege.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.58;Through various informants, I have learned that [From.GetTitledName] is making moves to take control of several key military positions.  If [From.GetSheHe] succeeds, [From.GetSheHe] will have plenty of troops to use for [From.GetHerHis] own wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_VAMPIRE.58;Through various informants, I have learned that [From.GetTitledName] is making moves to take control of several key businesses in the capital.  If [From.GetSheHe] succeeds, a lot of gold will flow through [From.GetHerHis] pockets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.58;Perhaps I can pay to get in on that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.58;I could interfere... or [From.GetSheHe] could owe me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.59;It's no concern of mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.59;To the [GetFromRootComplimentNounAdj] [Root.GetTitledName],\nI have become aware of your endeavors in the capital, and I believe that we may be able to assist each other.  I can help with some of your cost in exchange for some of the results.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.59;I could use the help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.59;[From.GetSheHeCap] isn't getting any of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTT_VAMPIRE.59;You will receive help with your scheme;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.60;[Root.GetTitledName],\nIt has not escaped my notice that you've been working to amass personal power in the capital.  I could easily make things much harder for you... unless you are willing to repay my overlooking this.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.60;I guess I have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.60;I won't submit to blackmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTT_VAMPIRE.60;Your efforts are sabotaged;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.61;To the [GetFromRootComplimentNounAdj] [Root.GetTitledName],\nI accept your proposal.  Soon you will see the results of our work.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.62;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI do not believe that your arrangement is in my best interests.  Your gold has been returned and you should mind your own affairs.\n\n [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.62;We'll see how far [From.GetSheHe] gets without me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.63;To the [GetFromRootInsult], [Root.GetTitledName],\nIt appears I have no choice.  Stay out of my business and I will aid you in return.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.64;To the [GetFromRootInsult], [Root.GetTitledName],\nYour low character is the subject of Greek plays.  I will owe you no favors and your feeble attempts at sabotage do not phase me.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.64;We'll see just how “feeble” they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.66;All my work has paid off.  By taking over various minor functions, I largely control who has access to the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] and when.  I can also be sure that people will be notified of my accomplishments while remaining ignorant of any rivals'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.66;All of my hard work has gone to waste.  Some key positions I tried to obtain have passed on to others who can't easily be bought or killed.  Now I just have a collection of unimportant bureaucrats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_VAMPIRE.66;Someone has noticed how rapidly I've been taking minor functions under my control and told the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] that I'm triying to stage a coup and seize power.  There's no evidence, since it's not true, but I can't go any further or I risk making this rumor seem right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_VAMPIRE.66;All my work has paid off.  By taking control of minor logistical roles, I've made sure that the best guards and equipment can be funneled to my demesne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_VAMPIRE.66;All of my hard work has gone to waste.  Some key positions I tried to obtain have passed on to others who can't easily be bought or killed.  Now I just have a collection of unimportant bureaucrats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCF_VAMPIRE.66;As I tried to move some important troops and equipment to my lands, it seems someone else has been noticing these “clerical errors” and trying to correct them.  The whole thing has become a completely disorganized mess, and some areas have been left completely unmanned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCG_VAMPIRE.66;All of my work has paid off.  I've been able to take control of several businesses in the area and slip them some exclusive contracts for the [From.GetTitle] and rather generous rates.  Soon I'll have all the gold and workers I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCH_VAMPIRE.66;Between worker shortages, contracts being given to other businesses, and some obstinate merchants, my work to gain economic control of the capital hasn't proven to be a good investment.  Perhaps it's time to focus elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCI_VAMPIRE.66;Even though I managed to get some businesses with key contracts, I've been hit with setback after setback.  Now I'm stuck running these failing businesses at a loss, and I can't just let them go, since I've arranged for them to handle several key goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.66;Everything is going as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.66;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.66;This is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.67;It seems that [From.GetTitledName]'s plan has come to fruition, and I've been given the access and control I was promised has come under my control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.67;That was a good investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.69;While I have managed to gain some control and power in the capital, I could have much more.  I should work on consolidating and improving my control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.69;I just need to put money in the right hands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.69;I can promise or call in some favors;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.69;A well-placed knife should do the trick;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_VAMPIRE.69;Now isn't the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.70;It just need to see some gold into the right pockets and I should have much more control over the capital;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.70;This is a good investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.70;This is getting too expensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_investment_give_up;Stop improving your influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.72;It seems like [From.GetTitledName] is trying to build up power and needs some help.  If I offer assistance, [From.GetSheHe] will owe me a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.72;It will be good to have [From.GetHerHim] owe me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTT_VAMPIRE.72;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will receive your offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.72;I'm not helping [From.GetHerHim] get more power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.73;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI have heard that you are looking for assistance with a political project.  I am willing to assist you, though you will need to make up for it later.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.73;I could use the help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.73;I should look for someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.73;This is getting out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.74;I know that [From.GetTitledName] owes me a favor.  I could have [From.GetHerHim] help me get the access I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.74;This is the best way to do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.74;I think I'd like to hold on to that favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.75;I haven't heard back from [From.GetTitledFirstName].  I don't think [From.GetSheHe] is going to accept my request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.76;There are some key positions that I need to get my own men into, but the current workers aren't easy to bribe.  Still, that just means I'll pay in steel instead of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.76;I'll go for a more useful, riskier target;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.76;I'll go for a smaller, easier target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.76;I think I'm getting in too deep;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_assassination_caught;You get caught;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_major_influence_progress;You gain a lot of progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_minor_influence_progress;You gain a bit of progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.77;Unfortunately, my assassination attempt didn't go as planned.  One of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s guards walked in on me right after.  I tried to explain away the blood and the knife, but he didn't believe me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.77;I'm ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.78;My work is done.  I've managed to bring more control of the realm into my hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.78;Soon, the whole realm will be under my control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.79;[From.GetTitledName] has decided to call in the favor I owe [From.GetHerHim] in exchange for putting some of [From.GetHerHis] staff in some key positions in the capital;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.79;That's not too bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.81;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI am pleased to accept your proposal.  In exchange for you putting my personnel in some key positions, I will help you in a similar situation in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.82;As much as I tried, I could not find anyone with access to the court positions I needed who was open to working with me.  I'll have to put aside my work for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.82;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.83;My guards have caught [From.GetTitledName] murdering a clerk.  It appears that [From.GetSheHe] has been killing various administrators and filling the positions to those loyal to [From.GetHerHim] in order to seize power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.83;Arrest the traitor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.84;As I've spoken to the court, I've found that I have lost a lot control - many of the bureaucrats and functionaries are more loyal to other members of the court than to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.84;This is terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.85;It feels like the number and quality of soldiers and guards around has been declining as of late.  It's almost like someone's been diverting the best soldiers and equipment for their own use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.85;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.86;The realm's funds have been getting tighter and tighter.  I fear that someone has been making financial decisions for the realm with their own benefit in mind, and siphoning money towards their own ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.86;But I need that money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.87;While I have managed to gain some significant political control of the realm, it does require continuing costs for “gifts” and replacing disloyal personnel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.87;The cost will be worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.87;The cost isn't worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.88;While I have managed to gain some significant control of the realm's military, it does require continuing costs for “gifts” and replacing disloyal personnel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.89;While I have managed to gain some significant economic control of the realm, it does require continuing costs for “gifts” and replacing disloyal personnel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.90;I have a lot of political control in the realm, but if I focus my efforts in one area, I could wrest key points from the [Root.Liege.GetTitle], and maybe control of the realm itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.90;As [Root.GetJobTitle], I'm in a good position replace many of the realm diplomats with my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.90;[Root.Liege.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] is a fool. I'll replace the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s diplomats under [Root.Liege.job_chancellor.GetHerHis] nose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.90;More funding will give me absolute control over who meets the [Root.Liege.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_VAMPIRE.90;As [Root.GetJobTitle], I can make some under the table deals for access to restricted areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_VAMPIRE.90;With the right shady deals, I can get access to restricted areas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTF_VAMPIRE.90;This isn't a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTG_VAMPIRE.90;If I could only surpass [Root.Liege.GetMyChancellorName] or [Root.Liege.GetMySpymasterName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.91;Lately, my diplomats have been less than helpful. It's almost like they are trying to sabotage me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.91;Who could be behind this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.92;It feels like most of my time at court is dealing with either the worst petitioners imaginable, or those who just sing the praises of my vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.92;Who is letting these people in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.93;I can't help but suspect people are going through private areas of the castle - my room, the treasury, private archives...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.93;Am I not even safe in my own castle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.94;While I have significant control over the distribution of the military, if I divert some of my resources to cover up the changes, I could reassign the actual distribution to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.94;If I have my guards cover for a while, I could divert soldiers to my land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_liege_troop_loss_in_one_year;Liege will lose troops in 1 year;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.94;I could use my food surplus to cover moving supplies to my troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_lower_prosperity;Reduced prosperity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_liege_supply_loss_in_one_year;Liege will lose supplies in one year;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.94;If I pay to hide losses from bandits, I could move the road guards to my land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_liege_road_guard_loss_in_one_year;Liege will lose road guards in one year;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_VAMPIRE.95;I can't spare the resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.95;Lately, I've had fewer guards around the castle and those that remain are of questionable quality and loyalty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.95;What happened to recruitment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.96;My lands have been suffering frequent supply shortages lately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.96;My vassals don't seem to be affected;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.97;Bandits have been running wild on the roads and the guards are nowhere to be seen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.97;Where did they go?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.98;Most of the realm's wealth passes through my desk, but with some subtle changes, a lot more of that could stay in my coffers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.98;Alter the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s trade deals to benefit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_coverup_fund;Use some funds to cover up the financial changes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.98;Size control of the ports and raise tariffs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_upset_mayor;This will upset your city vassals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.98;If I transfer my skilled workers to the capital, I can send even more back at the end;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_six_month_skilled_worker;In 6 months, gain additional skilled workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_VAMPIRE.98;It's not worth the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.99;I thought that my trade negotiation skills were good, but it seems that I've been pulling in less money than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.99;Where have I gone wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.100;It seems that the administrators of the ports no longer answer to me and their fees are being sent elsewhere.  I have so little control of the docks now that it would be difficult to simple remove these corrupt officials;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.100;I need to find their ringleader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.101;My workers are returning from the capital.  Using this as cover, I have also transferred a significant number of the best works to my lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.101;They'll come in handy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.102;There's been an unexplained shortage of skilled working lately, slowing construction throughout my demesne;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.102;I guess good help is hard to come by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.107;I've taken political, military, and economic control.  At this point, the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] barely has any real power left.  If I gather my resources together, I can oust [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] and take the throne with little fuss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.107;Soon I'll have it all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_liege_catch;[Root.Liege.GetTitledName] discovers your plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_liege_suspect;[Root.Liege.GetTitledName] hears rumors of your plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.108;Even with the control I already have, I should set aside some funds for the coup.  Some key individuals may need persuasion, and the soldiers would appreciate extra funding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.108;This is worth any expense;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.108;I'll use what I can spare;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.108;I'll set a bit aside;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_VAMPIRE.108;I already pay them. That's enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.109;This plan will be more secure if I call in some outside help from another member of the Blood Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.109;Fortunately, I'm owed some favors;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.109;I can do this on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.109;If only any of them owed me a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.110;Everything is in place.  I just need to gather the troops and I can quickly force to [Root.Liege.GetTitle] to give me the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.110;It's almost done;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.111;Everything is done.  My men quickly seized the castle and I was able to force the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] to sign over the [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetFullBaseName] to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.111;Now, this is real power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.112;I've been receiving disturbing reports about [From.GetTitledName].  It appears the [From.GetSheHe] is the one who has been diverting resources away from the capital and stealing political control. Worse, [From.GetSheHe] appears to be actively plotting to steal my throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.112;It's treason, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.113;I've been hearing disturbing rumors that one of my vassals is trying to leverage the power they've stolen into staging a coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.113;I have enemies everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.114;That underhanded fiend, [From.GetFullName], wasn't content with pulling support out from under me, has brought an army, seized the castle, and forced be to give him my title at sword point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.114;I will have revenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.115;[From.GetFullName] has decided to call in the favor I owe [From.GetHerHim] in exchange for lending support and troops to something [From.GetSheHe] has planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.115;I hope this doesn't get traced back to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.116;Having been thrown in prison, I'm notable to keep control of the network of power have have built up.  Now my agents have scattered to avoid capture or changed loyalties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.116;I'll have to start over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.117;It appears that [From.GetTitledName] has been building up power in my realm and has is using this power to claim that [From.GetSheHe] should be the rightful [Root.GetPrimaryTitles].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.117;I'll be watching [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.121;I've discovered that [influence_rival.GetTitledName] has been working to gain more political influence in the capital.  Sooner or later, our mechanations will come in to conflict.  Perhaps I should take care of it now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.121;I've discovered that [influence_rival.GetTitledName] has been working to gain control of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s military.  Sooner or later, our mechanations will come in to conflict.  Perhaps I should take care of it now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_VAMPIRE.121;I've discovered that [influence_rival.GetTitledName] has been working to gain more control of the realm's finances.  Sooner or later, our mechanations will come in to conflict.  Perhaps I should take care of it now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.121;Now's not the time;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.121;I just need to kill the men [influence_rival.GetSheHe]'s placed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.121;A few well placed bribes, and [influence_rival.GetHerHis] men will be mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_VAMPIRE.121;I'll let the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] handle [influence_rival.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_assassin_fail;Your assassination fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_assassin_caught;Your assassin is caught;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_assassin_success;Your assassination succeeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_bribe_failure;Your bribe fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_bribe_success;Your bribe is successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.122;My assassin was able to kill enough of [influence_rival.GetTitledName]'s loyal staff to weaken [influence_rival.GetHerHis] position, but was ultimately caught.  [influence_rival.GetSheHeCap] surely knows what I'm up to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.122;At least my influence is secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.123;An assassin has been caught killing the staff I placed in the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s court, and it appears that he was sent by [From.GetTitledName].  My position has been weakened, but now I know who my enemies are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.123;[From.GetSheHeCap] will pay for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.124;Unfortunately, my assassin was caught very quickly, before he could disrupt [influence_rival.GetTitledName]'s power base.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.124;That didn't go as well as I'd hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.125;An assassin has been caught trying to kill the staff I placed in [Root.Liege.GetTitledName]'s court.  Fortunately it was brought to an end before any real damage could be done and he revealed his master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.125;[From.GetTitledName] is my enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.126;My men have done their work properly and now [influence_rival.GetTitledName]'s power and influence has weakened and my position is secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.126;Things are back as they should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.127;It seems that someone is aware of the control I've gaining in the capital and is trying to undermine me.  Several of my agents have been killed or now seem to take orders from someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.127;I need to find out who is behind this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.128;It would appear that my bribes have not taken root.  Some of [influence_rival.GetTitledName]'s agents rejected my gifts, while others took them but continued serving their old master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.128;That was a waste of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.129;I've received some disturbing news - it appears that [influence_rival.GetTitledName] has been sneaking agents into the capital to usurp and undermine the functions of the state for [influence_rival.GetHerHis] own gain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.129;At least I know who my enemies are now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.130;Going over the books, I have found that many key positions in the realm are not as they should be.  Many positions have been replaced by those loyal to another.  I cannot allow these lesser men to steal my power;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.130;I now know who my enemies are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_council_not_called;Council members are able to join your wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_council_join_war;Your council members receive an offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.131;My Liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has requested that [From.GetHerHis] council come to aid [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] current wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.131;Of course I will join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.131;There's nothing in it for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.131;I am bound by blood. I cannot refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_VAMPIRE.131;Only if [From.GetSheHe] will make it worth my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_VAMPIRE.131;[From.GetSheHeCap] will owe me for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTF_VAMPIRE.131;We are even after this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_from_response;[From.GetTitledName] receives your response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.132;My Liege, [Root.GetTitledName],\nI will answer your call to arms and join you in your current war.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.133;My Liege, [Root.GetTitledName],\nI cannot join your war at this time.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.133;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.134;My Liege, [Root.GetTitledName],\nIn order to properly wage this war, I will need additional funding.  Provide this, and I will join your war.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.134;I do need [From.GetHerHis] men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.134;Sorry, I need the gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.135;My Liege, [Root.GetTitledName],\nI will join your war, though this will make the debt between us even.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.135;My Liege, [Root.GetTitledName],\nI will join your war, though I may need future aid from you in exchange.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.135;Fair enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.135;I suppose I need the help enough to consider that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.135;I'd don't need the help that badly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.136;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI agree to your offer.  You will join my war in exchange for the gold provided.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.137;[Root.GetTitledName],\nJoin my war, and I will aid you with your issues in the future.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.138;[Root.GetTitledName],\nJoin my war, and your debt to me will be considered repaid.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.139;[Root.GetTitledName],\nIn light of your request, I'm afraid I don't need your assistance at this time.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.140;With so much power concentrated on [Root.Liege.GetTitledName]'s capital, building a network of spies there would allow a great deal of control and information to flow to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.140;I'll begin right away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_begin_spy_network;Begin constructing a spy network.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.140;Another time, perhaps;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.141;Money makes the world go 'round, and this spy network is making it very clear;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.141;It will be money well spent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.141;Perhaps I should stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.142;The network of spies has taken time and attention, but to fully complete it I will need to focus on it more fully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.142;It's worth the effort;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.142;No, it's time to stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.143;At last, my work is finished.  My spies have ears in every corner of the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.143;Now let's see what they hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.144;I've discovered that [From.GetTitledName] has been planting spies throughout my capital.  I won't have my own lands turned against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.144;[From.GetTitledName] has informed me that [plotter.GetTitledName] has been planting spies throughout my capital.  We cannot let my own lands be turned against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.144;Round up the spies. [From.GetFirstName] will get what's coming to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.144;Bribe the spies to work for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.145;I've found out that [From.GetTitledName] has been building up spies in the capital.  The only question is what to do with this knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.145;Let [From.GetHerHim] do what [From.GetSheHe] wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.145;[Root.Liege.GetTitledName] would be please to hear of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.145;[From.GetSheHeCap] will owe me for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.146;[Root.GetTitledName],\nIt has come to light that you've been positioning men of low intent throughout the capital.  Some may even go so far as to suspect you of spying on the [Root.Liege.GetTitle].  I will, of course, keep this to myself, though I expect you to remember this in the future.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.146;I guess I own [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.146;I will not be blackmailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.147;It seems that [From.GetTitledName] was wise enough to accept my offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.147;It seems that [From.GetTitledName] was foolish enough to refuse my offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.147;Now to find the right time to call in this favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.147;[From.GetSheHeCap] will regret this, and soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.148;For my crimes, [From.GetBestName] has decided to enact an ancient vampire ritual known as the blood bond.  My will is made subservient to [From.GetHersHis] and I am no longer able to act against [From.GetHerHim].  Now that I am no longer any threat to [From.GetHerHim], I am free to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.148;My will is not my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.149;For the last few days, my body has been feeling strange.  I've had some difficulty keeping food down, and going outdoors makes my skin crawl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.149;I hope I'm not coming down with something;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.150;Over the last several days, my nausea has gone down, but mostly because I've lost my appetite.  My other issues have gotten worse - the sun makes my skin peel, and my chest hurts like my heart can barely beat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.150;Is this the end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.151;Whatever strange illness was coming over me has passed.  I feel as strong as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.151;I'm glad it wasn't something dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.152;My nausea is gone, but no longer desire normal food, instead craving, as strange as it sounds, human blood.  The chest pains are gone but my heart's stopped entirely.  At last, all these strange symptoms seem clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.152;I've become a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.157;Any one in power, especially an immortal, will find that their position and plans tend to make enemies.  I'm not sure if [new_rival.GetSheHe] got caught up in one of my plots, or if [new_rival.GetSheHe] just wants my titles and position, but it's become clear that [new_rival.GetBestName] hates me and wishes to undermine my work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.157;This hatred is mutual;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.158;I don't know what has gotten into that [From.GetManWoman]'s head, but [From.GetTitledName] has been ranting and raving about how I'm plotting [From.GetHerHis] downfall and undermining [From.GetHerHis] schemes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.158;Well, if [From.GetSheHe] already thinks I'm [From.GetHerHis] enemy, who am I to disappoint [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_VAMPIRE.159;Luciferian Pope Crowned;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.159;With my conquest of Rome, I have deposed and humiliated the Christian Pope, and in his place, set up a new Luciferian Pope, [new_pope.GetTitledFirstName].  Ruling from what was once the throne of Peter, through his leadership the God of Abraham will be cast aside and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s reign will now be ushered in. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.159;With the conquest of Rome, [From.GetBestName] has driven out the Christian Pope and established a new order in his place.  With [new_pope.GetTitledFirstName] to guide us, the world will be taken back for the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_VAMPIRE.159;After the fall of Rome to [From.GetBestName], it's conqueror has established a new Papacy in honor of [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.159;Luciferus Vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.159;The minions of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] have grown bold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.159;So one heathen has struck down another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.160;The person I have decided to feed on is under the protection of [From.GetHerHis] liege.  Feeding on [From.GetHerHim] could cause trouble if I am caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.160;I won't get caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.160;Perhaps I should feed on someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.161;Someone attacked [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName], apparently trying to feed on [FromFromFromFrom.GetHerHim] despite [FromFromFromFrom.GetHerHim] being under my protection.  We don't know anything for certain, but I suspect that [From.GetBestName] may be behind this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.161;I will be watching [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.162;Despite my orders, [From.GetTitledName] has attacked [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] and tried to feed on [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.162;[From.GetSheHeCap] will pay for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.164;Despite my orders, [From.GetTitledName] has fed on and killed [FromFromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.164;[From.GetSheHeCap] will burn for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.165;In the days since I was fed upon, my thoughts keep turning towards [From.GetTitledName].  [From.GetSheHeCap] can make me safe.  [From.GetSheHeCap] can make me happy.  I just need to serve [From.GetHerHim] and make [From.GetHerHim] happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.165;All of my thoughts are for [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.166;Over the last few days, [From.GetBestName] has been more pliant and subservient towards me.  My bite and blood has done its work - [From.GetSheHe] is now my thrall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.166;Always good to have a loyal servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.168;You have sent out summons to all of vampires under you to join in your blood feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.168;I can hardly wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTT_VAMPIRE.169;Invited to the blood feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.169;Dear [Root.GetBestName], I hereby invite you to a grand feast of blood in [From.Location.GetName]. Your presence at the feast would be greatly appreciated and I look forward to your attendance.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.169;Of course I will attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.169;I have no reason to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.170;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], I thank you for your invitation but I see no reason for me to attend your feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.170;Pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.171;The guests have finally arrived! All is ready, the castle has never looked lovelier, and our meals already have fear in their eyes - they know what's coming next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.172;[From.GetTitledFirstName] greeted us warmly to [From.GetHerHis] feast, and lead us to the great hall, where tables were set, music was playing, and fearful prisoners were chained up at end of the room, ready for our meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.174;I bring the first prisoner before the table, hold [From.GetHerHis] head over a trough, and slit [From.GetHerHis] throat.  I pass goblets underneath the slow of blood and pass them to each of my guests before taking a drink of my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.174;I've been waiting for this - my hunger can be quenched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.175;[From.GetTitledFirstName] lead one of [From.GetHerHis] prisoners over, slit its throat, and began passing its blood in goblets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.175;This is truly a feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.176;The monster, [From.GetTitledFirstName], brought me before a number of [From.GetHerHis] companions in a large dining hall, clearly intending to feed on my blood.  With no other opportunity, I changed into a wolf and charged through the guests and out the door.  I've escaped, but there's no doubt my secret is no longer safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.176;At least I'm out of the dungeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.177;When the prisoner was brought forth, instead of a meal we got a massacre - the prisoner was a werewolf who transformed, burst out of [From.GetHerHis] chains, and charged through us, ripping and tearing until [From.GetSheHe] reached the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.177;And I'm still hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.180;It seems the prisoners I have prepared were not enough for my guests, as one of them dragged in [From.GetFullName] and started draining [From.GetHerHim].  It wasn't long before all my guests had leapt on [From.GetHerHim] and drained [From.GetHerHim] dry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.180;What, my prisoners aren't good enough for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.181;It seems someone was tired of weakened and starved prisoners and decided to drag in fresh meat. We all tore into [FromFrom.GetHerHim] and drained [From.GetHerHim] dry in moments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.181;I don't think [From.GetTitledName] appreciated that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.182;It seems some of the information about our feast leaked out.  The details people have heard are vague and conflicting, so no one is quite sure what the truth is, but it's clear that we've been up to something terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.182;My reputation will recover, but it will take time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.184;As I mingled with the guests, I found myself enjoying the company of [new_friend.GetFullName].  I believe was could be friends beyond just this short party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.184;It's always good to make friends;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.185;As I mingled with the other guests, I found myself enjoying the company of our host more than I had expected.  I believe was could be friends beyond just this short party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.186;Throughout the party, every time [new_rival.GetFullName] opened [new_rival.GetHisHer] mouth, [From.GetHerHis] words seems specifically designed to irritate me.  I can't stand to deal with [From.GetHerHim] anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.186;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_kick_out_rival;[new_rival.GetFullName] is kicked out of the feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.187;For some reason, [From.GetTitledName] just seemed to be furious at me the entire feast.  Eventually [From.GetSheHe] just snapped and threw me out.  Whatever [From.GetHerHis] problem in, [From.GetSheHe]'ll regret insulting me like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.187;This isn't over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tt_kicked_out_of_feast;You are kicked out of the feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.188;When [old_rival.GetTitledFirstName] arrived at the feast, I was sure this was going to be trouble.  However, as the feast went on, we were able to easily remain cordial to each other and [old_rival.GetSheHe] didn't cause any trouble.  Perhaps it's time that we put our old rivalry behind us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.188;I have better things to do than defeat someone I don't really hate anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.189;While I was worried that I would regret attending [From.GetBestName]'s feast, [From.GetSheHe] was surprisingly gracious with none of the venom normally in [From.GetHerHis] voice.  Perhaps we can end this old rivalry of ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.189;I can focus my energy elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.190;I feel like I completely gorged myself on blood throughout the feast, beyond what I needed.  I just enjoyed the taste and the feeling of it sliding down my throat too much to want to stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.190;It was delicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.191;Finally, the partying has died down, guests are starting the leave, and the feast is over.  It was fun while it lasted, and my hunger is held back, but I have other matters to attend to now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.191;We should do this again some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.193;As I move through the halls, I spot a young maid. I'm alone with her, and she seems to be new. If I were to feed, surely no one would notice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.193;As I'm in my room, a servant enters, inquiring if I want anything to eat.  The lad seems new, and no doubt doesn't realize exactly what I would plan to feed on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_VAMPIRE.193;While I'm walking through the castle, I find a lone guard, asleep at his post. The guard clearly lacks discipline, and I am feeling a bit hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_VAMPIRE.193;While going through some papers, I was assisted by a young clerk.  He's new, and clearly eager to please his new lord. With no one else around, perhaps he could please me by sating my hunger as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.193;Just a taste;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.193;My hunger must be taken care of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_TT_VAMPIRE.193;If successful, complete remove hunger. May fail or get you caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.193;I'd better not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.194;The lone maid's blood is sweet on my lips.  With her gift, the hunger burning inside me is quelled.  It's a simple job to hide the body, and then no one is the wiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.194;I soon drain the eager boy's blood.  The meal he offered sates my monstrous hunger. It only takes a short time to dispose of his body, then all is well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_VAMPIRE.194;This foolish guard's blood is soon mine.  His permanent punishment at last slakes my hunger. In such an isolated area, it's simple to dispose of his body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_VAMPIRE.194;Taking the quick snack leaves my hunger cleared  and the young man dead. I take a short time to dispose of his body and the return to my work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.194;I feel much better now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.195;Unfortunately, we were not as alone as I thought. While the girl was in my embrace, two other maids stumbled upon up. Their screams alerted the guards before I could catch them and I was soon surrounded with her blood still fresh on my mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.195;Perhaps I took too long, or perhaps I was just unlucky, but as I was disposing of the servant's body, my chamberlain appeared along with a guard. While the guard was no match for me, he was able to delay me long enough for the chamberlain to alert the castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_VAMPIRE.195;While this guard may have been undisciplined, his shift replacement was not and my timing was poor. While I could easily take a single guard in a straight fight, his blow to the back of my head knocked me out and let him alert the castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_VAMPIRE.195;Unfortunately, this young clerk was not the only one eager to please their lord, as a maid came in to offer use refreshments and caught me.  I gave chase, but she ran right into a crowed hall where everyone could see the fresh blood covering my mouth and clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.195;This could cause trouble;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.195;I'm a vampire, what do they expect?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.196;I was able to drink my fill and dispose of the body, but perhaps I was not careful enough.  I've caught whispers about me around the castle and my court seems more guarded around me of late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.196;I need to be more careful;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.197;The maid must have suspected something was wrong as she soon began to hurry down the halls and move into a crowded area.  It seems I've missed this opportunity for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.197;The servant must have suspected something, as he quickly apologized for disturbing me and left the room.  When I turned to follow him, he'd already disappeared around a corner and I wasn't able to locate him again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_VAMPIRE.197;As I approached the guard, I must have been too loud, as he startled awake.  I may be strong, but an armed and alert guard is risky prey. Perhaps another time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_VAMPIRE.197;Unfortunately, the opportunity quickly passed, as a young maid entered the room offering refreshment.  The clerk had apparently lost track of time and left to take care of other chores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.197;I'm sure there will be other opportunities;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.198;Lately, I've been feeling odd and sluggish, like something has been sapping my mind and body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.198;What is this strange malady?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_VAMPIRE.199;An Empire of the Night;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.199;With my position as ruler secured, it is time for me to declare to the world the supremacy of the vampires.  Now, the human cattle must bow before me as the empire of the vampires rises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.199;The Imperium Sanguine has been established by [From.GetBestName], declaring a realm in which vampires rule over humans, viewing them merely as a source of blood to slake their thirst.  Here, a countil of elder vampires ensure that only the oldest and most powerful vampires reign so that no human would have the strength or position to undermine their supremacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.199;Now my rule truly begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_VAMPIRE.199;Vampires will take their rightful place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_VAMPIRE.199;These monsters must be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.200;While I have had an unfortunate face all my life, the vampiric energies coursing my veins have begun to twist it further, giving a me a supernatural, mishapen body.  However, while my appearance wanes, my and vampiric powers grow strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.200;Is this a blessing or a curse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.201;With the consolidation of my power in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I have established the [Root.Dynasty.GetName] as a powerful force in the vampiric world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_VAMPIRE.201;Now is our night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_VAMPIRE.203;Your hunger has become immense. You must feed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_VAMPIRE.203;You have begun to hunger for blood. You may now feed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.203;Your hunger for blood has increased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.204;Some eldritch connection I have with [From.GetBestName], whose blood I am bound to, has begun to alter my body, twisting it to a shape barely recognizable as human.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_VAMPIRE.204;What has [From.GetFirstName] done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.205;My sire, [From.GetBestName], has established a new highborn vampire house, claiming that our line is the most fit to rule over both vampires and the cattle on which we feed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_VAMPIRE.205;This power is now in my blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_VAMPIRE.206;Some eldritch connection I have with [From.GetBestName], whose blood I am bound to, has begun to twist my insides.  I am not sure what happened but the hunger feels... different somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_VAMPIRE.206;What is this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
