EVTOPTG_WEREWOLF.33;[From.GetSheHe] could use a friend at a time like this;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.34;An Opening...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.34;Observing [plot_leader.PlotTarget.GetTitledName], I've noticed that [plot_leader.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is fond of hunting.  During [plot_leader.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] next hunt, I could attack as a wolf and no one would be the wiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.34;When is [plot_leader.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] next hunt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_WEREWOLF.34;It will be a long wait before I can do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTTOOLTIP_WEREWOLF.35;Tell [This.GetTitledName] of the idea to kill [This.PlotTarget.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_WEREWOLF.34;Perhaps I can spread rumors of a rare animal in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_WEREWOLF.34;Forget the hunt – I'll just pay the guards to get “lost” on a normal trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_WEREWOLF.34;This is a bad idea – if I attack directly, I could get hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.35;The Plan is Ready;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.35;The hunting trip is finally ready.  Shall we get this plan underway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.35;All this waiting will finally pay off;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.35;The situation's changed.  Let's not do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.36;A Plot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_WEREWOLF.36;[From.GetTitledName] has a plan to get [plot_target.GetTitledName] alone and attack him as a wolf.  No one would know it was anything other than a wild animal attacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_WEREWOLF.36;[From.GetTitledName] has a plan to get a trained wolf to attack [plot_target.GetTitledName].  No one should know it was anything other than a wild animal attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.36;Sounds like every thing is accounted for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_WEREWOLF.36;Arrange for a wolf to attack [plot_target.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.37;The Plan is Approved;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.37;[From.GetTitledFirstName] approves of my plan to have a “wolf” attack [plot_target.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.37;The hunt is on;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.38;The Plot Proceeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.38;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is proceeding well. [From.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronounCap] will soon be torn apart by a wolf while hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.38;Perfect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.39;Frenzy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.39;In the heat of battle, I lost control of myself and turned into a wolf.  I killed many of my foes, but everyone there saw it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.39;Hopefully this will be limited to the commanders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.40;Hunger;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.40;No matter how much I eat, I can't seem to help but wolf down more and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.40;I need meat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.41;Rage Across the Realm;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.41;Whenever the moon waxes toward full, I've been finding myself getting angrier and angrier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.41;Why bother containing my rage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.42;Running With The Wolves;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.42;After a night spent running in the wild with other wolves, I feel free in a way I never could before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.42;I should do this more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.43;A Loud Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.43;I woke up this morning to the sound of a maid screaming when she saw the bed covered in blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.43;What did I do last night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.43;They act like they've never seen me covered in blood before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.44;Boredom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.44;The court has been boring for quite some time now.  While it has been boring, it has put people's suspicions about me out of their minds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.44;I guess boredom has its up-sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.45;Lost Control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.45;I lost control during the hunt and ended up tearing the prey to pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.45;At least I caught it. Technically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.46;The Thrill of the Fight;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.46;During that last battle, I completely lost myself in the thrill of the fight;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_WEREWOLF.46;I should let out the wolf more often;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.47;Regeneration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.47;While my wounds would have laid low any normal man, my body has already overcome its weakness;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.47;Much better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.48;Supernatural Recovery;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.48;Although my body and mind had been broken and crippled, the strength of the wolf still runs through my blood and restores my body and mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.48;I am renewed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_WEREWOLF.49;True Nature Revealed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.49;After my sudden and inexplicable recovery, there's no longer any use in hiding who I am - Everyone now knows that I'm a werewolf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.49;At least I don't need to hide now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.50;There has been whisperings around the court – it seems that someone saw me howling at the moon a few nights ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.50;Maybe they'll just think I'm crazy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.51;There has been whisperings around the court – it seems that someone saw my hunt a few days ago, including making the kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.51;They can't prove anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_WEREWOLF.52;Waking up after a moon-frenzy is always a blur and you only vaguely recall the events of that night, but your muscles ache, your jaw is sore, and your throat hoarse.  You must have been howling for hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_WEREWOLF.52;Waking up after a moon-frenzy is always a blur and you only vaguely recall the events of that night, but you're cold, wet, and still outside.  It seems you didn't even return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_WEREWOLF.52;Waking up after a moon-frenzy is always a blur and you only vaguely recall the events of that night, but you feel wet and sticky.  As you look down, you find yourself covered in blood that doesn't smell like yours.  You vaguely remember making a kill, but not what...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.52;I should wash up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.54;The peasants of [Root.GetName] are resisting all of my laws and declared that they refuse to submit to a monster;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.54;They better not try anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.55;The peasants of [Root.GetName] are refusing to pay taxes, claiming they refuse to aid whatever monstrous plans I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.55;I don't have any monstrous plans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.55;My soldiers will force them to pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.56;The soldiers in [Root.GetName] have been abandoning their duties and leaving the posts.  They claim that they refuse to serve a monster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.56;Bah! The weak flee while the strong remain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.57;I received new from [Root.GetName] that many bandits, cutpurses, and neer-do-wells that once resided there have fled to other realms.  It seems they fear being hunted and torn apart by werewolves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.57;As well they should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.58;The people of [Root.GetName] sleep soundly at night, knowing their lands are protected.  Where they once feared the howl of wolves, it now is a reassuring sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.58;My people are safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.59;Military recruitment is going strong in [Root.GetName].  There are rumors that I will turn those who distinguish themselves in battle, and many young men have joined the army to prove themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.59;And they will be rewarded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.60;I've been playing outside a lot, far away from everyone else, in the woods. Today I saw a wolf!  It came up and talked to me.  Well, it didn't really talk, but I knew what it wanted to say anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.60;I should tell [Root.Guardian.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.60;I'll keep this secret. Adults won't understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.61;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has been playing off in the woods a lot, far from everyone else.  [From.GetSheHeCap] even claims to be talking to wolves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.61;Unsupervised play is good for a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.61;[From.GetSheHeCap] shouldn't be allowed to do such dangerous things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_WEREWOLF.62;[From.GetFirstName] really enjoyed listening to how I was talking to the wolf, even if I don't think they believed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_WEREWOLF.62;[From.GetFirstName] wasn't happy that I was playing out in the woods, so I'm not allowed to go there anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.62;I'm glad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.62;Aww.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_WEREWOLF.64;[From.GetFirstName] has been a rather strange child.  Just yesterday, I saw [From.GetHerHim] growling at people when they got too close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_WEREWOLF.64;[From.GetFirstName] just had to have [From.GetHerHis] hair cut again.  It's growing far faster than I would expect from a child [From.GetHerHis] age, and [From.GetSheHe] seems to be growing body hair at a young age too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_WEREWOLF.64;It seems like every morning, we can't find [From.GetFirstName] in [From.GetHerHis] bed, and have to search all over for [From.GetHerHim], and every morning, we find [From.GetHerHim] sleeping outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.64;This is very odd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.64;Is [From.GetSheHe] a werewolf like me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_WEREWOLF.65;[From.GetFirstName] says I shouldn't growl at people.  Even if they get to close and I don't like them.  [From.GetSheHeCap] was acting really strange about it.  Is [From.GetSheHe] planning something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_WEREWOLF.65;[From.GetFirstName] says I've been growing too much hair.  But this is the same amount of hair I've always grown.  And [From.GetSheHe] has more hair than me anyway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_WEREWOLF.65;[From.GetFirstName] seems worried that I keep sleeping outside.  I like sleeping outside, though.  The bed is too stuffy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.65;I'm not weird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.66;I was in the woods, playing with the wolves again, and today one of them started following me home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.66;Can I keep him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.67;It's normal for a child to bring home some wild animal and want to keep it as a pet, but a wolf is no ordinary animal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.67;[From.GetFirstName] will be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.67;That's a dangerous animal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.68;[From.GetFirstName] agreed to let me keep the wolf as a pet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.68;I'm gonna name him Hunter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.69;[From.GetFirstName]'s wolf doesn't seem to like anyone, and lashes out at anyone who comes near it.  Except for [From.GetFirstName], who it follows around like a lost puppy.  There's something unusual about that child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.69;It bit me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.71;As I have gotten older, my wolf has become fearful of me and avoids me.  I haven't mistreated it – what's going on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.71;He's not coming back, is he?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.72;As I have gotten older, my wolf has become more domesticated and friendlier around members of the court;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.72;He's basically a dog now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.73;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has been a very unusual child, and all the signs seem to be pointing to one thing – [FromFrom.GetSheHe] may a werewolf, or will at least grow to become one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.73;The child must be brought to a [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.73;Lock [FromFrom.GetHerHim] up in the dungeon, where [FromFrom.GetSheHe] can't hurt anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_WEREWOLF.73;We must kill this abomination!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_WEREWOLF.73;Excellent! I'll introduce [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_WEREWOLF.73;Good for [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTF_WEREWOLF.73;There's nothing I can do about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.74;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has brought the child [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] before me.  [From.GetSheHeCap] has noticed some strange abilities and behavior from the child, and suspect that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] may be a werewolf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.74;I will pray for [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to bless [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] with strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.74;I will pray for [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to protect [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_WEREWOLF.75;Some [GetSelectedIngredient_1] should encourage [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] potential.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_WEREWOLF.75;I will use some [GetSelectedIngredient_1] to exorcise the demon within [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_WEREWOLF.75;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is worrying too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.75;I haven't done anything wrong, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] has locked me in the dungeon and called me a monster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.75;I didn't do anything! Please let me out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.76;[From.GetTitledFirstName] prayed over me and asked [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to protect me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.76;Protect me from what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.77;[From.GetTitledFirstName] prayed over my child.  The only left to do now is wait and trust [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.77;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.78;[From.GetTitledFirstName] performed some kind of ritual over me to get [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.78;Help me do what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.79;[From.GetTitledFirstName] performed a ritual over [FromFromFromFrom.GetFirstName] to get [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to help [FromFromFromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.80;We spoke to [From.GetTitledFirstName], and he thinks this is all an over-reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.80;I agree – there's nothing wrong with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.81;I spoke to [From.GetTitledFirstName], but [From.GetSheHe] doesn't see the problem.  [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks I'm just over-reacting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.81;What does [From.GetSheHe] know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.82;Now that my [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName] is of age, [From.GetSheHe] should reveal [From.GetHerselfHimself] as a werewolf and take [From.GetHerHis] proper place in society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.82;Yes, it is time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.82;No, [From.GetSheHe] can move at [From.GetHerHis] own pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.83;My [GetFromRelation] feels that it's time for me to reveal myself as a werewolf.  This will prove that I am a true ruler and fit to lead my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.83;But I'm not a werewolf...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.83;I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_WEREWOLF.83;I'm not ready...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.84;My [GetFromRelation] has listened to my suggestion, but it turns out that [From.GetSheHe] has not become a werewolf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.84;Oh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_WEREWOLF.85;My [GetFromRelation] has revealed [From.GetHerselfHimself] to the world. [From.GetSheHe] is strong and fit to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_WEREWOLF.85;My [GetFromRelation] has refused to reveal [From.GetHerselfHimself] to the world. I can only hope [From.GetSheHe] sees the light soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.85;This is my [GetFromRelation], in whom I am well pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.85;I am disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.86;On the night of my 16th birthday, I could feel a beast inside me take control.  I took on a form not of man nor wolf, but some powerful creatures in-between.  However, this was not enough to escape my prison, and all it did was let my captors know my nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.86;Knowing won't save them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.87;In the middle of the night, there were strange sounds coming from the dungeon.  I brought guards only to find a monstrous wolf-man in [From.GetTitledName]'s cell – As I suspected, [From.GetSheHe] is a werewolf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.87;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.88;Everything has pressed so heavily on my, I feel my mind cracking under the strain.  I'm not only not in control of my own life, but I'm also losing control over the wolf within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.88;I have to keep trying anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.88;It's easier to just give in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.89;Every part of my life has been terrible.  Is there any point in even trying to control what I am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.89;I should just let go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.90;My injuries have stuck with me.  My ability to heal has been weakened by trying to keep my power in check.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.90;I should let go. Use the strength of the wolf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.90;I just need patience.  I'll heal in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.91;I try to keep control over myself, but that just doesn't come naturally.  This just isn't me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.91;I should just let loose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.92;With the battle raging, the wolf in me wants to transform, fight the enemy myself, and feel their blood in my teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.92;No, I need to focus on commanding my troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.92;Why should I hold myself back?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.93;While I was traveling, some peasant boy starting mocking me in front of my traveling companions and the boy's friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.93;Transforming and ripping his hand off would teach him not to mock a [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.93;I should just ignore him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.94;The last few days have been an unending chain of stress, complaining vassals, and “urgent” matters of trivial importance.  I want to transform and run off, spend some time away from the stresses of modern life and embrace the wolf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.94;It's time for the wolf to take over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.94;I need to stay in control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_WEREWOLF.97;My father is able to turn into a wolf, and I'm sure I'll be able to do the same thing.  It seems weird that everyone is scared of that - it seems perfectly normal to me.  People who do that should be helped and encouraged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_WEREWOLF.97;My mother is able to turn into a wolf, and I'm sure I'll be able to do the same thing.  It seems weird that everyone is scared of that - it seems perfectly normal to me.  People who do that should be helped and encouraged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.97;I should tell my [GetFromRelation] about this idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.98;Young [From.GetFirstName] has been wondering about [From.GetHerHis] werewolf heritage and [From.GetHerHis] place in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.98;Lycanthropes are true rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_WEREWOLF.98;[From.GetHerHisCap] parents are monsters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.99;[From.GetTitledFirstName] agreed with my thoughts on werewolves and is helping me learn about how we interact with other people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.99;I'm so smart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.100;When I told [From.GetTitledFirstName] about my ideas, [From.GetSheHe] started telling me stories about werewolves ripping people apart and eating them.  I couldn't listen to any more and ran off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.100;This has to be a lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.1;Sensing a moment of weakness, my [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName] has issued a challenge.  Soon, we will fight over my title as [Root.GetPrimaryTitles].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.1;With me being too ill to defend myself, my [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName] has used my current state to challenge my rule.  Soon, [From.GetSheHe] will fight my champion to take my title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.1;It seems my recent actions have been received poorly by my [GetFromRelation]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that I am a tyrant and issued a challenge for my titles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_CHALLENGE.1;My past actions have reflected poorly on me.  With my reputation ruined, [From.GetTitledName] claims it's time for a change of leadership and has challenged me for my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_CHALLENGE.1;My parentage has left its physical mark, and the effects of this have drawn claims that someone so inbred is unfit to ruler.  Now my [GetFromRelation] has challenged me for my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_CHALLENGE.1;I came from my mother's womb clearly disfavored by [Root.GetHighGodName], left with a cursed appearance.  [From.GetTitledName] claims that this is a sign that I was not meant to rule and challenged me for my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCF_CHALLENGE.1;[From.GetTitledName] has declared that my small frame leaves me unsuited for fighting and believes that [From.GetSheHe] would be a better ruler. [From.GetSheHeCap] has challenged me for my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCG_CHALLENGE.1;With my frail strength, my [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName] claims that I lack the strength to rule and has challenged me for my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCH_CHALLENGE.1;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName], has declared that no woman is fit to rule over the werewolves in a man's place and is challenging me for the right to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCI_CHALLENGE.1;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName], has declared that no man is fit to rule over the werewolves in a woman's place and is challenging me for the right to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCJ_CHALLENGE.1;Because I have not yet proven myself with my new title, my [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName], has declared that [From.GetSheHe] would be better suited and challenged me for the right to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCK_CHALLENGE.1;Because I am too young to rule on my own, [From.GetTitledName] has declared that an older, more mature ruler should take over.  [From.GetSheHeCap] has issues a challenge to take my titles for [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCL_CHALLENGE.1;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName], claims that someone who is not a werewolf cannot possible rule over werewolves and is challenging me to a dual over my title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCM_CHALLENGE.1;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName], claims that my [Root.Culture.GetName] ways do not reflect the values and traditions of werewolves and challenged me for my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.1;Bring it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.1;There isn't any way out of this, is there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.1;Hrnng...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.2;It appears that [challenger.GetTitledName]'s challenge stems from me not observing werewolf traditions and values.  If I were to adopt those, the challenge would be averted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.2;I'll adopt the werewolf way of life;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.2;No, the old ways are best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TT_challenge_continue;The challenge continues as planned;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.3;[challenger.GetTitledName]'s challenge claims that I am not a werewolf, which would make me unfit to rule.  I've been keeping my condition secret, but if I reveal myself, the challenge would be canceled;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.3;Time to make myself known;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.3;No, I won't be pressured like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.4;The challenge claims that werewolves will only be ruled by one of their own.  If I reveal myself as a werewolf and live with the werewolf culture and customs, [challenger.GetTitledName] would have to back off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.4;Time to reveal myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.4;No, I won't be pressured like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.5;My liege has agreed to adopt a proper werewolf way of life.  While this is an improvement, it means I've lost the basis for my challenge against [challenged_party.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.5;There will be other opportunities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.6;My liege has transformed and revealed [challenged_party.GetHerselfHimself] as a werewolf.  [challenged_party.GetSheHeCap] has shown that [challenged_party.GetSheHe] is fit to lead and my challenge is void.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.6;There will be other opportunities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.7;My liege has transformed, revealed [challenged_party.GetHerselfHimself] as a werewolf, and embraces our customs and way of life.  [challenged_party.GetSheHeCap] has shown that [challenged_party.GetSheHe] is fit to lead and my challenge is void.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.7;There will be other opportunities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.8;Because of my young age, I will not be able to defend myself in the upcoming challenge.  Instead, that role will fall to my champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.8;I shall inform my Regent, [Regent.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.8;I shall be championed by my father, [Father.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.8;I shall be championed by my mother, [Mother.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.8;But I have no one to champion for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_CHALLENGE.8;I shall call my designated champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.9;My liege, [challenged_party.GetTitledName], has has [challenged_party.GetHerHis] right to the throne challenged under werewolf law.  Due to [challenged_party.GetHerHis] young age, [challenged_party.GetSheHe] will need a champion to fight for [challenged_party.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.9;I will be [challenged_party.GetHerHis] champion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.9;[challenged_party.GetHerHisCap] father do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.9;[challenged_party.GetHerHisCap] mother do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.9;I guess [challenged_party.GetSheHe]'s on [challenged_party.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_CHALLENGE.9;[challenged_party.GetHerHisCap] regent can do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TT_champion_liege;You become [challenged_party.GetFirstName]'s champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.10;My [challenged_party.GetDaughterSon], [challenged_party.GetFirstName], has been challenged for the throne under werewolf law.  Because of [challenged_party.GetHerHis] young age, [challenged_party.GetSheHe] will need a champion to fight for [challenged_party.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.15;[challenged_party.GetBestName] has been challenged for the throne and is unable to defend [challenged_party.GetHerselfHimself], so the challenger, [challenger.GetBestName] is unopposed.  The elders are willing to consider one other challenger for the right to fight for the title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.15;I'll take that challenge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TT_challenge_challenger;You enter consideration for the challenge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.15;I'll stay out of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.16;I've thrown my support behind you in the upcoming challenge.  I believe this makes us event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.16;I have [From.GetHerHis] support, at least officially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.17;Since [challenged_party.GetBestName] was not able to fight, and no one was brave enough to stand against me, I have won the right to be [challenged_party.GetPrimaryTitles];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.17;My reign begins now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.18;My [GetFromRelation]'s vassals have responded in support of [challenged_party.GetHerHim].  The support of the people strengthens my resolve, but I must remember that this is not a battle of popularity, but claws and steel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.18;Sadly, the vassals have come out in support of the usurper, [challenger.GetBestName] rather than their rightful liege.  While this is disheartening, this is not a battle of popularity, but claws and steel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.18;I will not let them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.18;I will show them who their true [challenged_party.GetTitle] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.20;[challenger.GetBestName] has issued a challenge over [challenged_party.GetTitledName]'s title.  With the fight coming up, everyone is waiting to see which vassal is supporting each combatant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.20;[challenger.GetBestName] has issued a challenge over [challenged_party.GetTitledName]'s title.  Due to [challenged_party.GetHerHis]'s age, [challenged_party.GetTitledName] will be represented by [champion.GetBestName]. With the fight coming up, everyone is waiting to see which vassal is supporting each combatant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_CHALLENGE.20;With the [challenged_party.GetTitle] unable to defend [challenged_party.GetHerselfHimself], [challenger.GetBestName] and [champion.GetBestName] have issued a challenge over [challenged_party.GetHerHis] title.  With the fight coming up, everyone is waiting to see which vassal will be supporting each combatant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.20;I will support [challenged_party.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TT_defender_challenger_favor;You no longer owe [challenged_party.GetTitledName] a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.20;I will support [champion.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TT_defender_champion_favor;You no longer owe [champion.GetTitledName] a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.20;I will support [challenger.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TT_challenger_favor;You no longer owe [challenger.GetTitledName] a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.20;I'll just wait and see how this plays out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.21;I've begun to hear from the vassals, and they are largely in support of me for the upcoming challenge.  My spirits are high, but I must remember that the real battle is one of claws and steel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.21;Unfortunately, most of the realm has come out in support of my opponent.  Still, this is only a minor problem – the real battle is one of claws and steel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.21;I won't lose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.22;Even though I asked, no one who was supposed to care for me was willing to be my champion.  Now, other people will fight over my title and I can't stop it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.22;I'm still too small to fight, and there isn't anyone who can champion for me, so now other people will fight over who can take my titles, and there's nothing I can do to stop it;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_CHALLENGE.22;My vassals fight over my titles, and I am too weak to even get out of bed.  Soon, one will come out on top and take what is mine, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.22;They'll pay for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.23;[challenged_party.GetBestName] has answered my challenge.  Soon, [challenged_party.GetHerHis] blood will be on my claws and I will reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.23;[challenged_party.GetBestName] has answered my challenge, and [champion.GetBestName] has stepped forth as [challenged_party.GetHerHis] champion.  Soon, we will meet on the field of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.23;This will be a day long remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.24;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has agreed to be by champion in the upcoming battle. [From.GetSheHeCap] will face [challenger.GetBestName] and defend my title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.24;I will pray for [From.GetHerHis] success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.24;I hope [From.GetSheHe] wins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.25;Due to the recent death of one of the participants, the current challenge has been canceled  Due to the unintentional nature of this cancellation, you are considered eligible to issue a challenge again, as the law permits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.25;Due to the recent death of one of the participants, the current challenge has been canceled;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.25;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.26;Because [challenged_party.GetTitledName] is unable to fight, the challenge has been made available to any party who wishes to claim it.  Though many stepped forward, the elders have selected [champion.GetTitledName] to be the other challenger.  Soon, we will meet on the field of battle, and fight for the right to rule [challenged_party.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.26;It makes little different, I'll still win.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.30;I have kept my nature a secret and it has brought me this opportunity – because [second_turn.GetTitledName] does not know I am a werewolf, if I shift and attack, I should catch [second_turn.GetHerHim] off guard.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.30;[second_turn.GetTitledName] is haughty and overconfident.  [second_turn.GetSheHeCap] thinks this will be an easy battle because [second_turn.GetSheHe] is a werewolf and I'm not.  [second_turn.GetSheHeCap] is wrong on both counts.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_CHALLENGE.30;The fight must surely look one-sided to any onlooker – a lowly human who took a werewolf's throne fighting against the strongest side of both man and wolf.  Wait until they see the truth – I am a werewolf and their true [Root.GetTitle]![Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.30;I'll reveal myself and charge in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.30;For now, I should keep my secret and fight normally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.30;No, I'll just focus on defense right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.30;No, I'll just keep my distance for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_WEREWOLF.31;As the fight goes on, my blood is pounding through my veins and my sight turns red.  There's no need to hold back now.  I give in to the wolf and let my rage take over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.31;My heart pound.  My muscles strain.  My mind is focused on one thing - ripping out [second_turn.GetTitledName]'s throat with my own teeth.  There's no reason to hold back.  I'm an animal and I'll fight like one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.31;This is how a werewolf fights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.32;I seem to have [second_turn.GetTitledName] on the defensive – I should use this opportunity to keep things that way.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.32;Our battle rages on.  Through the blows and movement, I see the opportunity to attack.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_CHALLENGE.32;Our battle is fierce and we are well matched, but the opportunity to strike is at hand.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_CHALLENGE.32;As the battle continues, neither has us is in the position for anything fancy, but I still need to strike.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_CHALLENGE.32;We are deep in the rush of battle – my heart is pounding and we are each at each others throats.  I need to find a way to gain the upper hand.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.32;Attack! Attack! Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTK_CHALLENGE.32;No quarter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTL_CHALLENGE.32;Focus on dismembering [second_turn.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.33;During the fight, my opponent was not watching [second_turn.GetHerHis] footing, and briefly lost [second_turn.GetHerHis] balance.  I can't pass up this opportunity.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.33;My enemy has not been careful with [second_turn.GetHerHis] feet and the ground is not are sure as [second_turn.GetSheHe] would think.  After one bad step, I can turn the fight in my favor.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.33;Charge [second_turn.GetHerHim] while [second_turn.GetSheHe] can't defend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.33;Tackle [second_turn.GetHerHim] off [second_turn.GetHerHis] feet and to the ground!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.33;Throw all your might into a single, powerful blow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.34;As the fight continues, my opponent's injuries are sapping [second_turn.GetHerHis] strength.  It seems [second_turn.GetHerHis] pain flared up, as [second_turn.GetSheHe] grabbed [second_turn.GetHerHis] side for a moment, giving me the opening I need.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.34;Strike while [second_turn.GetHerHis] guard is down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.34;Aim for [second_turn.GetHerHis] injury and make it worse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.34;Press the attack so [second_turn.GetSheHe] doesn't have time to recover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.35;In the middle of the battle, the pain from my injuries swelled to unbearable levels.  I can't fight well through this agony.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.35;I need to focus on defense to stay alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.35;I need to keep my distance to stay alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.35;Fight through the pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.36;There has been a slight lull in the combat – just enough that I think I can cast a spell to turn the tide of battle.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.36;I will bring [second_turn.GetHerHis] worst fears to life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.36;I will create copies of myself so [second_turn.GetSheHe] doesn't know what to dodge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.36;I will summon a spectral warrior to attack from behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.36;I will weave an enchantment to cloud [second_turn.GetHerHis] mind and senses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.37;The battle has pushed me to my limit.  I can barely stand.  I just need a moment to catch my breath.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.37;I'm exhausted.  I need a moment to catch my breath before I can fight again.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.37;It will only be a moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.38;One of my less scrupulous supporters appears have have sabotaged [second_turn.GetTitledName]'s equipment.  It doesn't appear that [second_turn.GetSheHe] has noticed, so I can use this to my advantage.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.38;In the fight, I noticed some unusual damage to [second_turn.GetFirstName]'s equipment.  One of my supporters must have performed a bit of sabotage.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.38;I should take advantage of this, and strike where they are undefended;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.38;Attack normally – I must fight honorably;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.39;Oh, sweet [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], I'm going to die!  This is more than I can take.  Maybe I should just get out of here while I still can.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.39;[second_turn.GetTitledName] is pushing me harder than I expected.  My knees are shaking and my heart if racing.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_CHALLENGE.39;I think I've gotten in over my head.  My heart is pounding, I'm breathing more heavily than I should, and I can't stop thinking that I'm going to die here.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.39;I'm out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.39;Just keep defending!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.39;Keep [second_turn.GetHerHim] away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.39;Try to attack to keep [second_turn.GetHerHim] away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_CHALLENGE.39;Run away while I still can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTF_CHALLENGE.39;Flee for my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAH_CHALLENGE.40;It appears that I was wrong about [From.GetTitledName] – [From.GetSheHe] is a werewolf.  [From.GetSheHeCap] shifted and manged to catch me off-guard with a brutal attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAM_CHALLENGE.40;It appears that I was wrong about [From.GetTitledName] – [From.GetSheHe] is a werewolf.  [From.GetSheHeCap] shifted right in front of me and I barely managed to dodge [From.GetHerHis] blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] came at me some decent strikes, and unfortunately a few managed to get through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBM_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] made a good effort at hitting me, but none of [From.GetHerHis] blows found their mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] has been focusing on keeping a solid defense up.  I'll need to find a way around it if I wish to hurt [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] is unrelenting.  [From.GetSheHe] made several brutal blows, and I'm afraid I couldn't avoid all of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDM_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] is overconfident.  [From.GetSheHe] came at me with several ferocious attacks, but no finesse – they were all easily avoided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] charged right at me!  I tried to block the blow, but [From.GetHerHis] momentum still carried the attack through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEM_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] charged right at me!  Did [From.GetSheHe] really think I couldn't dodge such a simple attack?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] stuck with a series of blows while advancing without relent.  I had to back off to avoid being completely overtaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFM_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] tried to advance on me, but I was able to keep [From.GetHerHim] at bay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] tried to keep me at bay with a series of quick, almost frantic attacks.  I regret that a few nicked me, but the blows carried little force behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGM_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] made a bunch of light, frantic blows.  I just hung back and let [From.GetHerHim] tire [From.GetHerselfHimself] out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] rushed at me, shouting about destroying my false god and striking down [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].  I was caught off-guard by the sudden ferocity, that [From.GetSheHe] managed to land some heavy blows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHM_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] rushed at me, shouting about destroying my false god and striking down [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].  [From.GetHerHisCap] wild swings were just as misguided as [From.GetHerHis] strange religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] is stronger than I thought.  I tried to block one of [From.GetHerHis] blows, and it almost forced me to my knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIM_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] is getting reckless.  While [From.GetHerHis] blow certainly had a lot of power behind it, it was so slow that an untrained servant could dodge it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCJH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] has been focusing on hitting my arms and legs for a while now, and it seems to be working.  I think [From.GetSheHe] intends to cripple me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCJM_CHALLENGE.40;I'm not sure what [From.GetTitledName] is trying to accomplish – those last blows weren't anywhere close to anything vital.  Maybe [From.GetSheHe] could eventually nick a limb, but nothing that won't heal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCKH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] charged right at me!  It looked like is should have been easy to dodge, but I lost my footing and got hit rather hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] leapt at me.  Between the force of the impact and some poor footing on my part, I hit the ground hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] threw all of [From.GetHerHis] effort into this attack.  I'd hoped to dodge it and create an opening, but I lost my footing and took the full force of the blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCNH_CHALLENGE.40;The pain from my injuries are getting to me.  I flinched for just a moment, and [From.GetTitledName] used the opening to land some solid hits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCOH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] managed to land a blow on one of my existing injuries.  The pain is terrible, and the damage will probably last a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCPH_CHALLENGE.40;I think [From.GetTitledName] can see that my pain is getting to me and has renewed [From.GetHerHim] assault as a result.  The pain is making it hard to dodge, and some of those blows got through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCPM_CHALLENGE.40;I think [From.GetTitledName] can see that my pain is getting to me and has tried to take advantage of it.  Fortunately, I'm still strong enough to dodge [From.GetHerHis] attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCQ_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] has put some curse or hex upon my mind!  My vision is filled with terrifying images and I just need them to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCRH_CHALLENGE.40;My eyes don't deceive me – [From.GetTitledName] has used [From.GetHerHis] magic to make copies of [From.GetHerselfHimself] to attack me from all sides.  While I dodged one, another stuck me from the side!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCRM_CHALLENGE.40;It seems that [From.GetTitledName] has decided to give up on fair play – [From.GetSheHe] used [From.GetHerHim] magic to create illusionary copies of [From.GetHerselfHimself]  Fortunately, I could track the real [From.GetManWoman] – the attacks from the illusions were naught but tricks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSH_CHALLENGE.40;I thought I have [From.GetTitledName]'s attacks well in hand, until I suddenly was stuck from behind! It appears [From.GetSheHe] summoned some spectral warrior to aid [From.GetHerHim] in the battle for a moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSM_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] thought that [From.GetSheHe] could turn the tide of the battle by using [From.GetHerHis] magic to summon some spectral warrior.  Fortunately, I'm skilled enough that I could hold them both back until the magic faded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCT_CHALLENGE.40;My vision has begun to swim and my balance has taken leave.  This is no doubt some trick for [From.GetTitledName]'s foul magics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCU_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] is hanging back, trying to catch [From.GetHerHis] breath.  Perhaps I can make use of this opening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVH_CHALLENGE.40;That [GetRootFromInsult], [From.GetTitledName], had one of [From.GetHerHis] supporters sabotage my equipment!  [From.GetSheHeCap] struck a deep would I may have trouble recovering from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCW_CHALLENGE.40;Although I could see that [From.GetTitledName] was shaken and scared, I was still caught off guard when [From.GetSheHe] just fled in terror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCXH_CHALLENGE.40;I knew my poor aim would come back to haunt me!  [From.GetTitledName] managed to slip it and get a rough blow on me before I could recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCXM_CHALLENGE.40;I was worried that my poor aim would get me killed, but that wasn't the case.  [From.GetTitledName] tried to slip past my defenses, but I was able to stop [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCYH_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] came at me with all of [From.GetHerHis] strength, completely unrestrained, giving in to the animal inside [From.GetHerHim].  [From.GetSheHe] pushed through all of my defences to claw and bite me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCYM_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] came at me with all of [From.GetHerHis] strength, completely unrestrained, giving in to the animal inside [From.GetHerHim].  [From.GetSheHe] pushed through all of my defences to claw and bite me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCZ_CHALLENGE.40;[From.GetTitledName] didn't attack when [From.GetSheHe] had the chance.  Instead, [From.GetSheHe] started to transform into a proper werewolf, though a bit too slowly to take immediate advantage of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.40;This means I win, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.40;Now is my chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.40;Don't panic! Don't panic! Don't panic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.40;I have [From.GetHerHim] on the run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_CHALLENGE.40;This isn't even a challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTF_CHALLENGE.40;I'm still in the fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTG_CHALLENGE.40;I'm having some trouble here;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTH_CHALLENGE.40;I'm on my last legs here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTI_CHALLENGE.40;I think I'm going to pass out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTJ_CHALLENGE.40;I think I'm going to die...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTK_CHALLENGE.40;The battle rages on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAH_CHALLENGE.41;I was right!  [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] was caught completely off-guard and I managed to get in a solid hit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAM_CHALLENGE.41;[enemy_turn.GetTitledName] must have suspected I was a werewolf.  When I changed forms, [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] was already moving to dodge the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBH_CHALLENGE.41;Though [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] made valiant attempts to dodge my attacks, [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] still could not avoid me forever and I landed a fine hit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBM_CHALLENGE.41;[enemy_turn.GetTitledName] is slippery and [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] avoided many of my attacks.  If [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] keeps this up, I may have to try something a bit more clever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_CHALLENGE.41;For now I hold off my attack and focus on defending myself until the time is right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDH_CHALLENGE.41;My unrelenting assault was able to overpower and defense that [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] could muster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDM_CHALLENGE.41;I sought to overwhelm [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] with an onslaught of blows, but [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] was able to stay one step ahead of me until I tired and my attacks weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEH_CHALLENGE.41;Ha!  My sudden charge was able to get in and strike [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] before [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] could mount an effective defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEM_CHALLENGE.41;I threw myself upon [enemy_turn.GetTitledName], but rather than hitting [enemy_turn.GetTitledName], all I hit was the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFH_CHALLENGE.41;I was able to use a series of hard and rapid attacks to push [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] back.  I was also able to land a few decent strikes as I went.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFM_CHALLENGE.41;I tried to drive [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] back, but [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] managed to hold [enemy_turn.GetHerHis] ground while still avoiding my attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGH_CHALLENGE.41;Although my attacks were light, the speed of them still allowed a few glancing blows, and they were largely successful at keeping [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] at a distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGM_CHALLENGE.41;Though none of my swings managed to connect, they still encouraged [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] to keep [enemy_turn.GetHerHis] distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHH_CHALLENGE.41;Calling upon the name of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I threw myself at the infidel and clove into [enemy_turn.GetHerHis] flesh – the evil witchcraft of [enemy_turn.GetHerHis] [enemy_turn.Religion.GetRandomGodName] offered [enemy_turn.GetHerHim] no protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHM_CHALLENGE.41;Has [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] abandoned me?  I stuck out upon the infidel, but it seems some dark blessing of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] protects [second_turn.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIH_CHALLENGE.41;I threw myself upon [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] with all my might, and tore into [enemy_turn.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIM_CHALLENGE.41;I threw myself at [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] with all my might, but the attack was too slow and [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] managed to avoid it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIW_CHALLENGE.41;I threw myself at [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] with all my might, but the attack was too slow and I fear I may have left myself open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCJH_CHALLENGE.41;As I cut at [enemy_turn.GetTitledName]'s arms and legs, I managed to land some strong, hopefully crippling blows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCJM_CHALLENGE.41;I swung again and again at [enemy_turn.GetFirstName]'s arms and legs, but they proved elusive targets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCKH_CHALLENGE.41;I launched myself at [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] and [enemy_turn.GetHerHis] poor footing caused [enemy_turn.GetHerHim] to land hard and at an awkward angle.  I hope [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] broke something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCKM_CHALLENGE.41;I launched myself at [enemy_turn.GetTitledName], but despite the poor footing, [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] still managed to slip out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLM_CHALLENGE.41;It seems that small opening wasn't enough.  [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] managed to avoid the blow despite the disadvantage [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMH_CHALLENGE.41;I launched several blows at [enemy_turn.GetFirstName]'s aching wound, and managed to tear the area up quite a bit.  That should keep [enemy_turn.GetHerHim] down for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMM_CHALLENGE.41;Despite [enemy_turn.GetFirstName]'s pain and wounds, [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] still had the speed and energy to avoid the attacks I made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCNH_CHALLENGE.41;I came at [enemy_turn.GetFirstName] hard and fast.  I got a few blows in, and I'm fairly sure [enemy_turn.GetHerHis] pain got a lot worse as [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] fought through it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCO_CHALLENGE.41;The moment I cast the spell, I could see the fear in [enemy_turn.GetBestName]'s eyes.  I don't know what [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] saw, but it terrified [enemy_turn.GetHerHim] to the core.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCPH_CHALLENGE.41;With my magic, I created a number of illusionary duplicates of myself.  Even though they were unable to actually injure [enemy_turn.GetTitledName], [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] was unable to tell which one to dodge and I got several nice hits in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCPM_CHALLENGE.41;With my magic, I created a horde of illusionary duplicates of myself, but somehow [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] was still able to track me and dodge my attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCQH_CHALLENGE.41;I quietly summoned a magical warrior out of [enemy_turn.GetTitledName]'s sight, then went of the attack.  While none of my blows hit, it left [enemy_turn.GetHerHim] occupied while my summon snuck in and stabbed [enemy_turn.GetHerHim] in the back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCQM_CHALLENGE.41;Although I summoned a magical warrior to assist me in the fight, [enemy_turn.GetFirstName] was still able to fend off both our blows until the summon faded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCR_CHALLENGE.41;I reached out with my magic and touched [enemy_turn.GetTitledName]'s mind.  [enemy_turn.GetSheHeCap] began to stumble, and [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] seemed lost and confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCS_CHALLENGE.41;I've decided to stay back for a bit and reserve my strength.  If I wear myself out, I'll only make mistakes and get myself killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCT_CHALLENGE.41;I can't take any more of this – I'm getting out of here while I still can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCUH_CHALLENGE.41;[enemy_turn.GetTitledName]'s poor accuracy cost [enemy_turn.GetHerHim] dearly – I was able to slip past [enemy_turn.GetHerHis] defenses and land a fierce blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCUM_CHALLENGE.41;[enemy_turn.GetTitledName] was quick to recover, and I missed any chance of taking advantage of the opening I was given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVM_CHALLENGE.41;I tried to aim around [enemy_turn.GetTitledName]'s defenses and predict [enemy_turn.GetHerHis] movements, but [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] kept managing to block my attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCWH_CHALLENGE.41;I used the opening to dig a deep gouge in [enemy_turn.GetTitledName]'s arm.  [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] will be feeling that for a while, and hopefully have trouble using it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCXH_CHALLENGE.41;I lunged at the enemy in a rage, clawing and biting, intending to rip out [enemy_turn.GetHerHis] throat.  I managed to get in several solid strikes on [enemy_turn.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCXM_CHALLENGE.41;I lunged at [enemy_turn.GetTitledName] in a rage, but [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] managed to just barely slip out of the way of all of my attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCY_CHALLENGE.41;I took the time to transform into a proper werewolf.  I may have lost an opportunity, but this strength should make up for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.41;I think [enemy_turn.GetSheHe] is almost down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.41;I think that should finish [enemy_turn.GetHerHim] off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.41;I might be in trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.41;I'm not sure how long I can keep this up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_CHALLENGE.41;I think I have the advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.43;I have kept my nature a secret and it has brought me this opportunity – because [first_turn.GetTitledName] does not know I am a werewolf, if I shift and attack, I should catch [second_turn.GetHerHim] off guard.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.43;[first_turn.GetTitledName] is haughty and overconfident.  [first_turn.GetSheHeCap] thinks this will be an easy battle because [first_turn.GetSheHe] is a werewolf and I'm not.  [first_turn.GetSheHeCap] is wrong on both counts.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.45;[first_turn.GetTitledName]'s attack failed to connect and has left an opening.  I can take this opportunity to get past [first_turn.GetHerHis] defenses and cause some real damage.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.45;This is the perfect time to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.46;[first_turn.GetTitledName] is hanging back, focusing on defending [first_turn.GetHerselfHimself].  If I wish to deal any meaningful damage, I will need a way to overcome [first_turn.GetHerHis] defenses.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.46;I will overwhelm [first_turn.GetHerHis] defenses with strong attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.46;I will focus on attacking through gaps in [first_turn.GetHerHis] defences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.46;I will stay back and wait it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.47;[first_turn.GetTitledName] swung wide, and left [first_turn.GetHerselfHimself] wide open to a counter-attack.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.47;Strike at [first_turn.GetHerHis] attacking arm;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.47;Go for the body;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.48;Smite that heathen [first_turn.GetDaughterSon] of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.48;Hack at [first_turn.GetHerHis] limbs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.48;Focus on dismembering [first_turn.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_CHALLENGE.48;Throw everything at [first_turn.GetHerHim] – no matter the cost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTF_CHALLENGE.48;Put all my strength into my hardest attacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.49;During the fight, my opponent was not watching [first_turn.GetHerHis] footing, and briefly lost [first_turn.GetHerHis] balance.  I can't pass up this opportunity.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.49;My enemy has not been careful with [first_turn.GetHerHis] feet and the ground is not are sure as [first_turn.GetSheHe] would think.  After one bad step, I can turn the fight in my favor.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.49;Charge [first_turn.GetHerHim] while [first_turn.GetSheHe] can't defend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.49;Tackle [first_turn.GetHerHim] off [first_turn.GetHerHis] feet and to the ground!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.50;[first_turn.GetTitledName] is pushing me harder than I expected.  My knees are shaking and my heart if racing.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.50;Keep [first_turn.GetHerHim] away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.50;Try to attack to keep [first_turn.GetHerHim] away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.51;I just need a moment to rest and heal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.52;[Root.Not_transformed]As the fight continues, my opponent's injuries are sapping [first_turn.GetHerHis] strength.  It seems [first_turn.GetHerHis] pain flared up, as [first_turn.GetSheHe] grabbed [first_turn.GetHerHis] side for a moment, giving me the opening I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.52;Strike while [first_turn.GetHerHis] guard is down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.52;Aim for [first_turn.GetHerHis] injury and make it worse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.52;Press the attack so [first_turn.GetSheHe] doesn't have time to recover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.53;I will bring [first_turn.GetHerHis] worst fears to life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.53;I will create copies of myself so [first_turn.GetSheHe] doesn't know what to dodge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_CHALLENGE.53;I will weave an enchantment to cloud [first_turn.GetHerHis] mind and senses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.55;One of my less scrupulous supporters appears have have sabotaged [first_turn.GetTitledName]'s equipment.  It doesn't appear that [first_turn.GetSheHe] has noticed, so I can use this to my advantage.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.55;In the fight, I noticed some unusual damage to [first_turn.GetFirstName]'s equipment.  One of my supporters must have performed a bit of sabotage.[Root.Not_transformed];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.56;The challenge has been made.  The fighters have been chosen.  The time has come to battle for the rightful claim to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.56;I won't lose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.61;[champion.GetTitledName] is no longer able to continue the fight.  Though others may try to take it from me, I'm the clear ruler of [challenged_party.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.61;To the victor go the spoils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.62;After [champion.GetTitledName]'s loss in the challenge, [challenger.GetFullName] has taken rulership over [challenged_title.GetName] and is now [challenged_title.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.62;I can't believe I lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.62;I still have other titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.63;My injuries from the battle are too severe.  Not only have I lost the fight, but my life as well.  [challenger.GetFullName] is now the [challenged_title.GetRulerTitle] of [challenged_title.GetName] and I am naught but worm-meat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.63;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], take me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.64;My injuries are too severe for me to go on – I've lost this fight. [challenger.GetFullName] is now the [challenged_title.GetRulerTitle] of [challenged_title.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.64;Medic!  I think I've broken... something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.66;With that final clash, my opponent is beaten.  The day is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.66;I am now [challenged_title.GetRulerTitle] of [challenged_title.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.66;My liege's rightful title is defended;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.66;No one will take what is mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.67;The battle is over, and my champion, [champion.GetBestName], has emerged victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.67;I am grateful to you, [champion.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.68;The battle is over, but [champion.GetTitledName]'s victory is of little comfort to me – he was nothing more than another challenger, here to steal what was once mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.68;I couldn't even defend my own title...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.68;I still have other titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.69;My injuries are too severe for me to go on – I've lost this fight, and my life as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.69;At least I went down fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.70;These last wound were too great – I can't continue the fight.  I must bow out and heal, but this won't be the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.70;These wounds might last a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_CHALLENGE.72;The fight isn't going my way – I'm not sure I can survive another blow like that;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_CHALLENGE.72;This isn't going well.  One more hit like that and I'm done for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.72;I surrender! Just let me live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.72;I won't give in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.73;I've managed to get out with my life, if not my dignity.  Some may claim I was a coward, but there's little point staying in a hopeless fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.73;Discretion is the better part of valor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.76;After a fierce duel between [challenger.GetBestName] and [champion.GetBestName], [From.GetDynName] has emerged as the victor and new ruler of [challenged_title.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.76;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] save the [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.77;After a fierce and bloody duel, both [challenger.GetBestName] and [champion.GetBestName] have succumbed to their wounds.  With no one left to challenge my reign, I remain [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.77;I retained my title, but at the cost of a loyal servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.77;Despite being undefended, I won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.80;Some of my opponents strikes have managed to cut deep, and I've been given some rather nasty wounds,;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.80;This could take some time to heal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.81;I can't even stand, let along fight.  My opponent is in no better shape than I am.  Perhaps if I could get over there, one more strike would be all it took... No, I can barely remain conscious, let alone move.  I guess we both lost this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.81;Medic...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.82;Since I am no longer the [challenged_title.GetRulerTitle] of [challenged_title.GetName], there is no reason for the challenge to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.82;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.83;Since [From.GetBestName] is no longer [challenged_title.GetRulerTitle] of [challenged_title.GetName], there is no longer any cause for us to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.84;[champion.GetTitledName] has served me loyally, and recently protected my title in a challenge against [challenger.GetBestName]. Perhaps [champion.GetSheHe] should be rewarded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.84;[champion.GetSheHe] earned it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.84;I'll be sure to tell everyone how great [champion.GetSheHe] fought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_CHALLENGE.84;[champion.GetSheHe] was just doing as I commanded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.85;My [GetFromRelation] has rewarded me for my faithful service in the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.85;It's good to be appreciated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.86;My [GetFromRelation] has been telling everyone about my exploits in the challenge from [challenger.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_CHALLENGE.87;I think I can begin to feel the change coming upon me.  I should take this opportunity to shapeshift to get full use of my strength, though it means missing out on a chance to attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_CHALLENGE.87;I need this strength;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_CHALLENGE.87;I have to keep attacking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TT_forfeit_challenge;You forfeit the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WEREWOLF.103;With the consolidation of my power in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I have established the [Root.Dynasty.GetName] as a powerful force in the werewolf world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_WEREWOLF.103;Now is our day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
