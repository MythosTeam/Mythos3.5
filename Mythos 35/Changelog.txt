v3.5.0

Enhancements:

Version change to keep up with the Mythos version number.

Bug Fixes:

Yearly loan payment event now checked to see if you actually have a loan.
Thor went back to school and got an education. I'm so proud of him!
Cultural buildings now require the province to be that culture to both be built and be active.
Capital buildings now require the province to be a capital to be active.
Panacea should now correctly remove the diseases if it was used during the symptom phase.
Hidden werewolves will no longer accidentally reveal themselves due to a non-hidden Werewolf Killed character modifier. This modifier will now only be visible to other werewolves.
The Recruit Commander event should now respect ROOT's graphical culture.
Loans are bad, mmkay? But they have been fixed. Probably.
Djinn towns for cities now rely on the tribal versions of themselves to be built instead of city mummy temples.
